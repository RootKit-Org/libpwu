In this example the target process consists of 2 functions. One function is running in a loop, the other is not used. Here libpwu is used to create a new thread which will execute the unused function. In reality, you will probably want to inject your own code and then run it in a new thread.

To run this example:

$ make
$ ./target

Then, in the same directory in a separate terminal:

$ ./exec


Sources for the target are included, but I heavily advise you to use the included target binary in your tests rather than building the target from source. Differences compilers are likely to invalidate the offsets used by this example.
