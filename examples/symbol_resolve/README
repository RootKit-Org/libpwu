!!!!
!!!! THIS EXAMPLE IS CURRENTLY BROKEN DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE SIGNATURE
!!!! OF get_region_by_path() (previously get_region_by_meta()) IN libpwu v1.0.2
!!!!


In this example, libpwu is used to determine the address of the puts() function which gets dynamically linked to the target. If you would like to make use of libc in your payloads, make your injector resolve the addresses of all functions you're interested in as is done here, and then mutate your payload to call the correct addresses before injecting.


To run this example:

$ make
$ ./target

Then, in the same directory in a separate terminal:

$ ./exec


Sources for the target are included, but I heavily advise you to use the included target binary in your tests rather than building the target from source. Differences compilers are likely to invalidate the offsets used by this example.
