Here the target process is repeatedly printing the sum of 4 and 16. In this example, libpwu is used to hook the summing function and add 3 to the sum. Many practical uses here, like hooking TLS encryption to get the plaintext.

To run this example:

$ make
$ ./target

Then, in the same directory in a separate terminal:

$ ./exec


Sources for the target and payload are included, but I heavily advise you to use the included binaries in your tests rather than building the target and payload from source. Differences compilers/assemblers are likely to invalidate the offsets used by this example.
