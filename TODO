TOTEST:
-new read_mem() and write_mem() for high amount of data. Check if it works as expected
-raw_inject()


TODO:
-implement some way to easily search for memory regions that meet specified conditions 

REFACTOR:
-Deletion (freeing) of maps_data. done via maps_obj, which aren't involved in its 
 creation. Very silly.

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
