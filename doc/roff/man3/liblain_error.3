.SS LIBRARY
Lain memory manipulation library (liblain, \-llain)
.SS SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
_Thread_local int ln_errno;

void ln_perror();
const char * ln_strerror(const int ln_errnum);
.EE
.SS STRUCTURE
When a \f[B]liblain\f[R] function return a value indicating an error
(typically \-1 or NULL), the integer \f[I]ln_errno\f[R] is set to hold a
unique error number that describes the error that occurred.
Each error number has a corresponding textual description.
.PP
There are 3 classes of error numbers:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]21XX\f[R] : Errors caused by the user of the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]22XX\f[R] : Errors caused by an internal bug in the library.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]23XX\f[R] : Errors caused by the environment (such as a failure to
allocate memory).
.PP
The \f[I]cm_errno\f[R] value is stored in thread\-local storage.
Setting it in one thread does not affect its value in any other thread.
.SS FUNCTIONS
The \f[B]ln_perror()\f[R] function outputs the textual description of
the last error to occur, stored in \f[I]ln_errno\f[R], to standard
error.
.PP
The \f[B]ln_strerror()\f[R] takes a error number and returns a pointer
to the textual description for the said error number.
.PP
The \f[I]ln_errno\f[R] value is stored in thread\-local storage.
Setting it in one thread does not affect its value in any other thread.
.SS EXAMPLES
None provided.
See \f[B]perror\f[R](3) and \f[B]strerror\f[R](3) for identical
functionality.
