.SS "description"
\fBget_caves()\fR populates \fBmaps_entry\->caves_vector\fR with caves that are at least \fBmin_size\fR bytes in size\.
.SS "parameters"
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB*m_entry\fR : entry for the target segment\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBfd_mem\fR : open file descriptor for \fB/proc/<pid>/mem\fR for the target process\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBmin_size\fR : minimum size of a cave to search for in bytes\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fB*first_cave\fR : pointer to a \fBcave\fR structure where the first found cave will be copied to\.
.IP "" 0
.SS "return value"
number of found caves is returned on success, \fB\-1\fR on fail\.
.SS "notes"
The search is performed by searching for continuous 0x00 or 0xFF bytes\.
